# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

**Level**: 🟡 Intermediate  
**Type**: Recommender System - Collaborative Filtering  
**Dataset**: MovieLens Dataset

## 📋 Project Overview

This project builds a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It learns user preferences and movie similarities to suggest personalized movie recommendations. Perfect for understanding recommender systems, matrix factorization, and similarity metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn collaborative filtering fundamentals
- Implement user-based and item-based filtering
- Master similarity metrics (cosine, pearson)
- Handle sparse user-item matrices
- Evaluate recommendation quality
- Build scalable recommendation pipeline

## 📊 Dataset Information

MovieLens dataset with user ratings for movies.

### Features
- **UserID**: Unique user identifier
- **MovieID**: Unique movie identifier  
- **Rating**: User rating (1-5 stars)
- **Timestamp**: Rating timestamp
- **Movie Metadata**: Genres, titles, years

### Challenge
- **Sparsity**: Most user-movie pairs have no rating
- **Cold Start**: New users/movies with no history
- **Scalability**: Millions of users and items

## 🔍 Key Techniques

- **User-Based CF**: Find similar users, recommend their favorites
- **Item-Based CF**: Find similar movies, recommend based on user history
- **Matrix Factorization**: SVD, NMF for dimensionality reduction
- **Similarity Metrics**: Cosine similarity, Pearson correlation
- **Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K

## 📈 Expected Results

- **RMSE**: ~0.85-0.95 (rating prediction accuracy)
- **Precision@10**: ~15-25% (relevant recommendations in top 10)
- **Coverage**: ~80-90% (percentage of items recommendable)
