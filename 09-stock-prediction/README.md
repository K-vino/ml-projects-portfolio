# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

**Level**: 🔴 Advanced  
**Type**: Time Series Forecasting - Deep Learning  
**Dataset**: Stock Market Data (Yahoo Finance)

## 📋 Project Overview

This project predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It introduces time series forecasting, sequential data processing, and financial data analysis. Perfect for learning RNNs, LSTMs, and time series deep learning.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn time series forecasting fundamentals
- Master LSTM and RNN architectures
- Handle sequential financial data
- Implement sliding window techniques
- Apply technical indicators as features
- Understand financial ML challenges and ethics

## 📊 Dataset Information

Stock market data from Yahoo Finance API.

### Features
- **OHLCV Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- **Technical Indicators**: Moving averages, RSI, MACD
- **Time Series**: Daily stock prices over multiple years
- **Multiple Stocks**: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.

### Challenge
- **Non-Stationarity**: Stock prices have trends and seasonality
- **Volatility**: High variance in financial markets
- **External Factors**: News, events affect prices unpredictably
- **Overfitting**: Models may memorize rather than generalize

## 🔍 Key Techniques

- **LSTM Networks**: Handle long-term dependencies
- **Sliding Windows**: Create sequences for training
- **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators, lag features
- **Data Normalization**: MinMax scaling for neural networks
- **Walk-Forward Validation**: Time series cross-validation
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple LSTM models

## 📈 Expected Results

- **RMSE**: Varies by stock volatility
- **Directional Accuracy**: ~55-65% (better than random)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns analysis
