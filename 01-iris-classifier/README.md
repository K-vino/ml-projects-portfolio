## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
```

### Installation
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd 01-iris-classifier
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

## 📈 Methodology

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Load the iris dataset from scikit-learn
- Explore dataset structure and statistics
- Check for missing values and data types

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summary of features
- Distribution plots for each feature
- Correlation analysis between features
- Pairplot visualization to understand class separability

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train-test split (80-20)

### 4. Model Building & Training
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear classification approach
- **Decision Tree**: Non-linear, interpretable model
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for better accuracy
- **Support Vector Machine**: Margin-based classifier

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Cross-validation scores

### 6. Model Comparison
- Compare all models using various metrics
- Select the best performing model
- Feature importance analysis

## 📊 Expected Results

### Model Performance (Expected)
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~97% | ~97% | ~97% | ~97% |
| Decision Tree | ~95% | ~95% | ~95% | ~95% |
| Random Forest | ~97% | ~97% | ~97% | ~97% |
| SVM | ~97% | ~97% | ~97% | ~97% |

### Key Insights
- Petal length and petal width are the most discriminative features
- Setosa species is easily separable from the other two
- Versicolor and Virginica have some overlap but are still distinguishable

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** - Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** - Statistical visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will understand:

✅ How to load and explore a dataset  
✅ Basic data visualization techniques  
✅ Feature correlation and relationships  
✅ Train-test split methodology  
✅ Multiple classification algorithms
